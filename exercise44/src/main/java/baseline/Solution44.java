        Pulling data from a file into a complex data structure makes parsing much simpler. Many programming
        languages support the JSON format, a popular way of representing data.
        Create a program that takes a product name as input and retrieves the current price and quantity for that
        product. The product data is in a data file in the JSON format and looks like this (you will create this file as
        `exercise44_input.json`):

        The file is in the JSON format. Use a JSON parser to pull the values out of the file (e.g. https://github.com
        /google/gson (https://github.com/google/gson) ).
